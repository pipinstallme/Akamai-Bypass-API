Host the page on localhost or somewhere where you have full admin permission. { because we need to execute scripts }

If you're a config maker or you know how to deal with HTTP requests, this is for you.

monitor the http request once you host the page, implement that in your tool/config.

once you click execute, you'll get the acf sensordata in the response, parse it and use in your configs/tools as you wish.

the akamai bypass jar file is a custom made script and it supports only 100 requests in 10 minutes, so i created this so that a new acf-sensordata is created without limits.

[ this is not properly tested so you might get some BUGS! ]
( this script doesn't work for all the AKAMAI BYPASS, SO TRY YOUR LUCK )

custom AKAMAI script ready âœ…
